### What is it? ###
This is a web application for searching emails by request in search engines.
At the moment, search in Google and by local file is implemented.
### Why is this?
In my work, I often have to search for materials and components.
And anyone who has ever done this could notice a complete discrepancy between what is on the company websites and what they actually offer.
Thus, the entire search always turns into torture: "out of stock,
in six months on pre-paid order, the manager is not there." You can spend several hours on this, but still not find anything.
Therefore, I wrote a program for myself that would find emails of potential
suppliers for a specific request without viewing their websites. (separate topic)
Thus, now 15-20 minutes are spent on searching, instead of 2-3 hours.
### Why a web application?
Because it is convenient, because the browser is available on any platform, and the application itself
can be located on an internal corporate server.
### How to search?
To search in Google, simply enter a query. Other search engines do not allow this.
Therefore, to search in other search engines, save the HTML output from the browser and
upload it to the application. Click Search!
At the moment, the application is done at about thirty percent of what was intended.
It is planned to finish saving previous search queries in a local database.
And tidy up the appearance and code in small ways.
